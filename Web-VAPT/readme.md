## 🔧 Exploitation Tools

---

## 1. Host Header Injection Tester
- Automates detection of host header injection vulnerabilities.
- Implements multiple attack vectors:
  - Flawed validation (non‑numeric ports, arbitrary subdomains, compromised subdomains)
  - Duplicate Host headers
  - Absolute URL in request line
  - Line wrapping (indented Host)
  - Host override headers (`X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Host`, `Forwarded`, etc.)
- Interactive workflow with sensible defaults:
  - Target URL
  - Malicious callback domain (default: `attacker.com`)
  - Subdomain keyword (default: `attacker`)
  - Authentication headers (none/bearer/cookie)
  - Downgrade HTTPS → HTTP and force HTTP/1.1 options
- Outputs grouped results (**Successful**, **Interesting**, **Failed**) and saves a JSON report.

**Example Individual Script Usage:**
```bash
python3 host.py
```

Follow the prompts to configure your test. Results are printed to the terminal and saved in host_inject_report.json.

## 2. JWT Exploitation Utilities
- Automates JSON Web Token exploitation techniques.
- Supports JKU/JWKS hosting, signature bypasses, and cryptographic attack chains.
- Designed for extensibility and integration with GitHub Pages for callback endpoints.


**Example Individual Script Usage:**
```bash
python3 jwt_exploit.py
```

Interactive prompts guide you through token manipulation and exploitation scenarios.

## 3. Insecure Headers Enumeration
Overview
headers.py is the third tool in the Web VAPT Tools suite. It scans target URLs for missing or misconfigured HTTP security headers based on OWASP and PortSwigger best practices. The workflow supports both authenticated and unauthenticated scanning, and deduplicates URLs so only unique base paths are tested (ignoring query parameters).

**Features**
✅ Detects missing headers such as:
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Strict-Transport-Security
- Content-Security-Policy
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy
- Cross-Origin headers (CORP, COOP, COEP)
  
✅ Flags misconfigurations, e.g.:
- CSP containing unsafe-inline, unsafe-eval, or wildcards (*)
- HSTS missing max-age, includeSubDomains, or preload
- X-Frame-Options using deprecated ALLOW-FROM
- Referrer-Policy set to unsafe-url
  
✅ Special handling for deprecated headers:
- X-XSS-Protection is only flagged if present (correct state is absent).
  
✅ Supports authentication workflows:
- No authentication
- Bearer token
- Cookie string
  
✅ Flexible output formats:
- Group by header → list all affected URLs under each misconfigured header
- Group by URL → list all misconfigured headers for each target
  
✅ User can choose:
- Plain URLs only (easy copy/paste into Excel reports)
- URLs with inline details (brackets showing what was misconfigured)

  
**Example Individual Script Usage:**
```bash
python3 headers.py
```

**📸 Screenshot Usage**

<img width="1016" height="1284" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58f82d0c-9a6d-4513-b905-d93777cb1de3" />


You will be prompted to:
- Paste a list of URLs (e.g., from BurpSuite → Copy all URLs).
- Select authentication type (none, Bearer token, or Cookie).
- Choose output format (group by header or group by URL).
- Decide whether to display plain URLs or detailed findings.

**Example Output**

Option 1 (Group by Header, plain URLs):
Content-Security-Policy
  - http://example.com
  - http://test.com

Strict-Transport-Security
  - https://secure.example.com


Option 2 (Group by URL, detailed findings):
Target: http://example.com
  - Content-Security-Policy → Misconfigured (Contains unsafe-inline)
  - Strict-Transport-Security → Misconfigured (Missing includeSubDomains)

Target: https://secure.example.com
  - Referrer-Policy → Missing


Notes
- Misconfigured headers are highlighted in red in the terminal for quick visibility.
- Deduplication ensures parameterized URLs (e.g., ?id=1, ?id=2) are only tested once.
- Designed for extensibility: new header checks can be added easily.


## 4. SSL/TLS Cipher Enumeration
Overview ssl_ciphers.py is the fourth tool in the Web VAPT Tools suite. It automates the enumeration of supported SSL/TLS cipher suites on a given host and port, highlighting weak or deprecated ciphers.
Features
✅ Attempts handshake with a comprehensive cipher list (TLS 1.3, TLS 1.2, legacy CBC/RC4/MD5/SHA1, PSK, SRP, GOST).
✅ Flags weak ciphers including:
- CBC mode (BEAST, POODLE, Lucky13 vulnerabilities)
- RC4 stream cipher (deprecated due to bias attacks)
- SHA1/MD5 hashing (collision-prone, broken)
- NULL and EXPORT ciphers (insecure by design)
✅ Deduplicates results so each cipher is reported once.
✅ Outputs grouped results:
- Strong ciphers (safe for use)
- Weak ciphers (deprecated/insecure)
- Unsupported ciphers (not negotiated by server/OpenSSL build)
✅ Provides summary counts for quick visibility.


**Example Individual Script Usage:**
```bash
python3 ssl_ciphers.py
```

Results are printed to the terminal as shown above.


## 5. Request Smuggling Exploitation
Overview smuggling.py is the fifth tool in the Web VAPT Tools suite. It automates crafting and sending of HTTP request smuggling payloads to test for front‑end/back‑end parsing discrepancies.

**Features**
✅ Supports multiple smuggling techniques:
- Content-Length vs Transfer-Encoding mismatches
- Duplicate headers (e.g., two Content-Length values)
- Embedded/duplicated requests inside the body of another request
✅ Raw socket implementation ensures exact byte‑level control (not sanitized by higher‑level libraries).
✅ Optional proxy mode: route traffic through Burp Suite or another proxy for interception.
- Configure with --proxy <ip> (default port 8080).
✅ Interactive workflow:
- Target host and port
- Payload type (CL/TE, duplicate headers, embedded request)
- Proxy option for interception
✅ Outputs grouped results:
- Successful smuggling attempts
- Interesting anomalies
- Failed attempts


**Example Individual Script Usage:**
```bash
python3 smuggling.py
```

Results are printed to the terminal and can be intercepted in Burp Suite for deeper analysis.
