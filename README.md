## 🌐 BT-WebSuite

**Category:** Web VAPT | **Language:** Python

A custom web security testing suite built for Web Application VAPT engagements. Automates the tedious early-phase recon work so you can focus on actual exploitation. Designed to work alongside Burp Suite Professional durign Web VAPT engagements, semni-automating tedious or repetive checks.

**Features:**
- Full interactive prompt driven style 
- Automated endpoint enumeration and directory fuzzing
- Parameter discovery and injection point mapping
- Custom fingerprinting for common web vulnerabilities
- Modular design — run individual modules or chain them into a full pipeline

**Use case:** Speeds up the recon and discovery phase of web application penetration tests, particularly useful for large-scope assessments with many subdomains or endpoints.

```bash
cd BT-WebSuite
python3 bt_websuite.py
```

## 📊 CIS-NessusToExcel

**Category:** Reporting / Compliance | **Language:** Python

Eliminates hours of manual post-scan formatting. Takes raw Nessus CIS compliance scan output and transforms it into a clean, structured, client-ready Excel workbook — complete with comply/non-comply summaries, finding categorisation, and remediation tracking.

**Features:**
- Parses `.nessus` CIS benchmark scan files automatically
- Generates Excel reports with comply / non-comply breakdown
- Summary dashboard tab for executive reporting
- Colour-coded findings by compliance status
- Allows clients to track and prioritise remediation with ease

**Use case:** Every infrastructure engagement that includes a CIS benchmark assessment. Saves significant post-engagement time and ensures consistent report formatting across all clients.

```bash
cd CIS-NessusToExcel
python3 nessus_compliance_to_excel.py -f Linux_HCR.nessus
```
OR
```bash
cd CIS-NessusToExcel
python3 nessus_compliance_to_excel.py -d Nessus_CIS_Scans
```

## 🔍 Infra-VA / VA-Automater

**Category:** Infrastructure VAPT | **Language:** Python

A terminal-driven automation tool that handles the most repetitive and time-consuming parts of VA reporting cycles. Built specifically for teams running recurring quarterly or annual vulnerability assessments.

**Features:**
- Full interactive prompt driven style 
- Removes previously risk-accepted findings automatically from new scan results
- Buckets findings by vulnerability category for structured reporting
- Detects outdated/EOL software versions and flags them
- Reassesses and validates CVSS scores against current NVD data
- Closes remediated findings in your tracking spreadsheet
- Generates delta reports showing what's new, fixed, and outstanding

**Use case:** Quarterly VAPT reporting cycles where you need to reconcile new scan results against historical findings, risk acceptances, and remediation tracking sheets — without doing it manually every time.

```bash
cd Infra-VA
python3 va_automater.py
```

## 💥 OSED-Automation

**Category:** Exploit Development | **Language:** Python

A set of automation scripts built during OSED (Offensive Security Exploit Developer) exam preparation. Reduces the repetitive manual setup involved in exploit development workflows so you can iterate faster.

**Features:**
- Full interactive prompt driven style 
- Bad character analysis — automated identification of bad chars in shellcode buffers
- Shellcode generation helpers and integration scaffolding
- Skeleton exploit script generation for common vulnerability classes (SEH, stack BOF, etc.)
- Offset calculation and EIP/RIP control verification helpers
- Pattern generation and cyclic offset detection
- ROP/ASLR Bypass with command prompts to run in Target machine

**Use case:** Buffer overflow and exploit development engagements, CTF prep, and OSED/OSCE3 exam preparation. Also useful as a teaching aid for understanding exploit development fundamentals.

```bash
cd OSED-Automation
python3 bof_toolkit.py
```
