# VAPT-Tools
VAPT Tools is a collection of automation scripts for security testing across Web, Mobile, and Cloud. Organized by domain, it streamlines vulnerability assessment, exploits common attack vectors, and outputs clear reports for authorized penetration testing.

# 🌐 Web VAPT Tools

The **Web VAPT** folder contains automation scripts focused on web application penetration testing.  
Currently included:

---

## 1. Host Header Injection Tester
- Automates detection of host header injection vulnerabilities.
- Implements multiple attack vectors:
  - Flawed validation (non‑numeric ports, arbitrary subdomains, compromised subdomains)
  - Duplicate Host headers
  - Absolute URL in request line
  - Line wrapping (indented Host)
  - Host override headers (`X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Host`, `Forwarded`, etc.)
- Interactive workflow with sensible defaults:
  - Target URL
  - Malicious callback domain (default: `attacker.com`)
  - Subdomain keyword (default: `attacker`)
  - Authentication headers (none/bearer/cookie)
  - Downgrade HTTPS → HTTP and force HTTP/1.1 options
- Outputs grouped results (**Successful**, **Interesting**, **Failed**) and saves a JSON report.

**Usage:**
```bash
python host.py
```

Follow the prompts to configure your test. Results are printed to the terminal and saved in host_inject_report.json.

## 2. JWT Exploitation Utilities
- Automates JSON Web Token exploitation techniques.
- Supports JKU/JWKS hosting, signature bypasses, and cryptographic attack chains.
- Designed for extensibility and integration with GitHub Pages for callback endpoints.
**Usage:**
```bash
python jwt_exploit.py
```

Interactive prompts guide you through token manipulation and exploitation scenarios.

## 3. Insecure Headers Enumeration
Overview
headers.py is the third tool in the Web VAPT Tools suite. It scans target URLs for missing or misconfigured HTTP security headers based on OWASP and PortSwigger best practices. The workflow supports both authenticated and unauthenticated scanning, and deduplicates URLs so only unique base paths are tested (ignoring query parameters).

**Features**
✅ Detects missing headers such as:
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Strict-Transport-Security
- Content-Security-Policy
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy
- Cross-Origin headers (CORP, COOP, COEP)
  
✅ Flags misconfigurations, e.g.:
- CSP containing unsafe-inline, unsafe-eval, or wildcards (*)
- HSTS missing max-age, includeSubDomains, or preload
- X-Frame-Options using deprecated ALLOW-FROM
- Referrer-Policy set to unsafe-url
  
✅ Special handling for deprecated headers:
- X-XSS-Protection is only flagged if present (correct state is absent).
  
✅ Supports authentication workflows:
- No authentication
- Bearer token
- Cookie string
  
✅ Flexible output formats:
- Group by header → list all affected URLs under each misconfigured header
- Group by URL → list all misconfigured headers for each target
  
✅ User can choose:
- Plain URLs only (easy copy/paste into Excel reports)
- URLs with inline details (brackets showing what was misconfigured)
  
**Usage**
Run the tool interactively:
```bash
python3 headers.py
```

**📸 Screenshot Usage**

<img width="1016" height="1284" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58f82d0c-9a6d-4513-b905-d93777cb1de3" />


You will be prompted to:
- Paste a list of URLs (e.g., from BurpSuite → Copy all URLs).
- Select authentication type (none, Bearer token, or Cookie).
- Choose output format (group by header or group by URL).
- Decide whether to display plain URLs or detailed findings.

**Example Output**

Option 1 (Group by Header, plain URLs):
Content-Security-Policy
  - http://example.com
  - http://test.com

Strict-Transport-Security
  - https://secure.example.com


Option 2 (Group by URL, detailed findings):
Target: http://example.com
  - Content-Security-Policy → Misconfigured (Contains unsafe-inline)
  - Strict-Transport-Security → Misconfigured (Missing includeSubDomains)

Target: https://secure.example.com
  - Referrer-Policy → Missing


Notes
- Misconfigured headers are highlighted in red in the terminal for quick visibility.
- Deduplication ensures parameterized URLs (e.g., ?id=1, ?id=2) are only tested once.
- Designed for extensibility: new header checks can be added easily.

⚠️ Note
These tools are intended only for authorized security testing and educational purposes.
Do not use them against systems without explicit permission.

Special thanks to **iamdenis1234** for their work on deriving public keys from two different JWTs obtained during testing.  
Their contribution helped shape the JWT exploitation utilities included in this repository.
